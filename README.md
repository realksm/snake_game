# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game in Java. The game features a snake that moves around the screen, trying to eat apples and grow in length. However, the snake must avoid colliding with itself or hitting the walls, as this will result in a game over.

## Prerequisites

To run the Snake game, you need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Locate the `SnakeGameMain` class and run it as a Java application.
4. The game window will open, and you can start playing the Snake game.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's movement.
- Try to eat the apples that appear on the screen to increase your score and the length of the snake.
- Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
- The game will end if the snake hits a wall or collides with itself.
- Press the space bar to restart the game if it ends.
- Press the 'P' key to pause the game.

## Features

- Smooth and responsive snake movement.
- Randomly generated apples for the snake to eat.
- Collision detection to handle collisions with the walls and the snake's body.
- Score tracking to keep track of the player's score.
- Game over condition when the snake collides with a wall or itself.
- Pause functionality to pause the game during gameplay.
- Restart option to reset the game after it ends.

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the game by modifying the code:

- Adjust the game speed by changing the `delay` value in the `GamePanel` class.
- Customize the appearance of the snake, apples, and other elements by replacing the corresponding image files in the resources folder.
- Modify the game logic, scoring system, or add new features by extending the existing codebase.
